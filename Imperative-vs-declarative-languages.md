Declarative Language :
- Very similar to algebraic expression.
- You just specify what you want and not how you want it
- how is it beneficial ?
  - I had never looked at SQL with this perspective.
  - So advantage of sql being Declarative is u just ask what you want from db. 
    DB in its background can figure out optimized way of doing it
  - CSS is Declarative in a way u just tell the html that u want xyz element to be blue by just using selector.
  - Had that been implemented in eg. java -> u would have to write if else for selection of element and then paint it blue.
